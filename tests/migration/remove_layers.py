    '''Remove certain layers from a model's stored HDF5 weight files.

    Basically, I was getting the error:
    `you're trying to load a weights file with 17 layers into a model with 16 layers`

    Which was basically because there was an extra `spectrogram` layer that wasn't there
    in the new version of `kapre`.

    Since auto-incrementing weight naming is a bit different between versions, 
    we couldn't just do "by_name".
    
    Arguments:
        *files (str): weight files to check.
        search (str): the search term to use when looking thru layer names.
        doit (bool): If this is not set to True, then it will just print 
            out the layers that it finds. This is a precaution to prevent 
            you from accidentally deleting weights.
